/Users/rpolkinghorne/Desktop/litdex/jcp-136-014109:This uses an approach where the amplitudes evolve independently, and only the weights are variational.  At each timestep, the evolved wavefunction is expanded over the gaussians, starting with the one with largest overlap, and proceeding recursively.  This ensures that only one of a set of parallel basis kets will be included in the expansion.
/Users/rpolkinghorne/Desktop/litdex/jcp-83-3009:Main result: in circumstances where the local harmonic approximation is exact, gaussian approximants evolve independently, even in variational dynamics.

/Users/rpolkinghorne/Desktop/litdex/jcp-87-5302:this describes a trick.  the quadratic exponent of a Gaussian is split into a complex position and momentum, then the wavepacket is propagated along the classical trajectory starting with their real parts.  this is supposed to give the propagator between squeezed states that aren't connected by a classical trajectory.
